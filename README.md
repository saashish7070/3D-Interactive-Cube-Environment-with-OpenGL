# 3D-Interactive-Cube-Environment-with-OpenGL

![Project Preview](project_preview.png)

## Description

The "3D Interactive Cube Environment with OpenGL" project is an interactive 3D graphics demonstration created using the OpenGL graphics library and Pygame framework. The project provides a basic environment where users can navigate a 3D space, interact with cubes, and explore fundamental concepts in real-time 3D rendering.

## Features

- Dynamic rendering of cubes in a 3D environment.
- User-controlled camera movement for exploration.
- Keyboard input for cube manipulation and camera control.
- Randomized cube positions to create an ever-changing environment.
- Immediate mode rendering of cube surfaces and edges.
- Basic lighting effects and color variation for cubes.
- Pause functionality to freeze and unfreeze the environment.
- Initial game speed and directional speed settings.
- Limited optimization for an interactive experience.

## Future Enhancements

The project's potential for enhancement is vast. Some ideas for future improvements include:

- Introducing advanced lighting models and shaders for realistic lighting effects.
- Implementing physics simulations for accurate cube interactions and collisions.
- Adding user interface elements for more intuitive controls and information.
- Expanding the object variety and incorporating texture mapping for realism.
- Allowing users to save and load custom scenes for more personalized experiences.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-cube-environment.git`
